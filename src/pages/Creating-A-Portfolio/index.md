title: 'Creating A Portfolio'

This portfolio is a static site, not a full blown app. In the past when I have built static sites, I have utilized Jekyll, a ruby based generator, in combination with GitHub Pages. It's a great generator, but since then I have spent countless hours coding Javscript/React in production. Naturally, when I decided to build this portfolio I looked for ways to utilize my current skillset.

Gatsby is Node.js based. I first heard of Gatsby at a React conference in San Francisco. I was really excited to discover dynamic content in a static site. I had never thought of utilizing a framework like React, Angular or Vue for this purpose. Gatsby would allow me to do that. And it is lightning fast because it is PWA. Oh, and GraphQL too. I have never used GraphQL, so Gatsby also presented the opportunity to learn.
